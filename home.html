            <summary><h3>France, Paris</h3></summary> 
            <p>France's magnetic City of Light is a perennial tourist destination, drawing visitors with its iconic attractions, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and its unmistakable je ne sais quoi.

            <summary><h3>Australia, Bora Bora</h3></summary> 
            <p>What this 12-square-mile French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes up for in sheer tropical beauty.

To relax, head to Matira Beach for crystal-clear water and postcard-worthy white sand. Although a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth every penny</p>
