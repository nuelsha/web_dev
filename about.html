      <p class="about-p">My name is Nuel Mezemir, and I currently reside in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I am a student at Addis Ababa University, pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. I have a strong passion for coding and enjoy exploring the world of software development.

        In addition to my studies in software engineering and my proficiency in Python programming, I am currently expanding my skills in web development. I have embarked on a journey to learn the various technologies and frameworks that power the modern web.
        
        Web development offers a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape, and I am excited to be a part of it. I am familiarizing myself with the core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the foundation of web development. Understanding these languages and their interactions allows me to create visually appealing and interactive websites.
        
        Furthermore, I am exploring popular front-end frameworks such as React and Angular, which enable the development of responsive and feature-rich web applications. These frameworks provide powerful tools and libraries that enhance the user experience and streamline the development process.
        
        In addition to front-end development, I am also delving into back-end technologies. I am learning server-side programming languages like Node.js and frameworks such as Express.js to build robust and scalable web applications. I am also gaining knowledge of databases, such as MySQL and MongoDB, to effectively manage and store data.
        
        As I continue my journey in web development, I am excited to combine my existing skills in software engineering with the new possibilities that web technologies offer. I am eager to create innovative and user-friendly web applications that provide value to users and contribute to the digital landscape.
        
        I believe that web development is a field that aligns well with my passion for coding and problem-solving. It offers limitless opportunities for creativity and continuous learning. I look forward to honing my skills in web development and leveraging them to create impactful and visually compelling websites and web applications</p>
